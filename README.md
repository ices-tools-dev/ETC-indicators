# ETC-indicators

Process for retrieving, cleaning and preparing figures for the updated CSI032 indicator.
Data sources are:
from ICES:
- SAG, full dataset of the year 2018
- Official catches until 2017 (to be published in May 2019)

other sources:
- Mediterranean catches from GFCM
- Mediterranean stock assessments as used in the STECF 19-01 report: https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reports/cfp-monitoring/-/asset_publisher/oz5O/document/
- Full STECF database as of 25 April 2019

All data needed to run the code are freely available and detailed in the main indicator document. 
Here, we only include the document defining stocks by ecoregion, and the comparisson with the atributions used in the STECF report previously cited.
